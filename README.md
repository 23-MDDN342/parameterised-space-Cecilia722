### 2024 MDDN342 Project 1:Atlas Silk

Cecilia Hu

In this project, I had the opportunity to refactor traditional Atlas Silk into code. Similar to traditional Atlas Silk craftsmen, I started by composing code to create a colorful stripe with blocks of different colors, then added varying degrees of displacement to create symmetrical patterns.

Next, I duplicated and arranged them to form a piece of silk, and then added tassels of different lengths to give them a more handmade feel. In my drafts, the entire page was made of Atlas Silk, but in actual production, I felt it was a bit monotonous, so I added girls wearing dresses of the same color as characters. They are waiting for their favorite color of Atlas Silk to be made. Because I dislike outlines, I added shadows to their hands to distinguish them. I also added a bit of shadow to the tassels to make them more noticeable. In terms of color selection, I used a soft gray-green palette, so sometimes it's necessary to pay attention to distinguish, otherwise, it might not be clear.

Finally, I added a talking pattern to the background to emphasize space and to enhance the atmosphere and contrast with the movement speed of the little girls.

In terms of code, I mainly used side-scrolling. I didn't want the movement of the screen to be too cluttered, so I just adjusted some of the side-scrolling data, but most of the shapes still follow a left-to-right movement just in different ways. I put more effort into designing the silk and characters to ensure I could fully present the story.

I prefer the speed of the web version's movement. The generated GIF, when combined with motion blur, may appear a bit fast, but it's smoother and more natural. However, when they are enlarged to zoom in as a background, they all look very smooth. I think this is the influence of scale on the work.
